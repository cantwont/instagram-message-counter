# Instagram Message Counter
Uses your Instagram exported data to count how many messages you have with a specific person

## How to use:
1. Go to [this link](https://accountscenter.instagram.com/info_and_permissions/dyi/)
2. Copy these settings: 
	"Some of your information"
	"Messages"
	"Download to device"
	Set the data range to whenever you want, I suggest all time
	Set the format to JSON
	Set the quality to whatever you want, however I only tested this with low quality
	Then click create files, this shouldn't take longer then 10 minutes
3. Run the Python script, it will prompt you for a directory. Just extract the files you downloaded before, and then go to your_instagram_activity -> messages -> inbox -> and then whoever you want. Here's an example of me running the code:
